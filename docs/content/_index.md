Prince is a Python library for multivariate exploratory data analysis in Python. It includes a variety of methods for summarizing tabular data, including principal component analysis and correspondence analysis. Prince provides efficient implementations, using a scikit-learn API.

## Methods

    cat?(Categorical data?) --> |"‚úÖ"| num_too?(Numerical data too?)
    num_too? --> |"‚úÖ"| FAMD
    num_too? --> |"‚ùå"| multiple_cat?(More than two columns?)
    multiple_cat? --> |"‚úÖ"| MCA
    multiple_cat? --> |"‚ùå"| CA
    cat? --> |"‚ùå"| groups?(Groups of columns?)
    groups? --> |"‚úÖ"| MFA
    groups? --> |"‚ùå"| shapes?(Analysing shapes?)
    shapes? --> |"‚úÖ"| GPA
    shapes? --> |"‚ùå"| PCA
```

## Installation

```sh
pip install prince
```

üé® Prince uses [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) for making charts.

## Correctness

Prince is tested against scikit-learn and [FactoMineR](http://factominer.free.fr/). For the latter, [rpy2](https://rpy2.github.io/) is used to run code in R, and convert the results to Python, which allows running automated tests. See more in the [`tests`]([/tests/](https://github.com/MaxHalford/prince/tree/master/tests)) directory.

## Support

I made Prince when I was at university, back in 2016. I've had very little time over the years to maintain this package. I spent a significant of time in 2022 to revamp the entire package. Prince has now been downloaded over [1 million times](https://pepy.tech/project/prince). I would be grateful to anyone willing to [sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/MaxHalford) me. Sponsorships allow me to spend more time working on open source software, including Prince.
